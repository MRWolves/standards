# MRAS Application Team Software Documentation Guide

## Documentation: What and Why?

In order to talk about software documentation, we first need to agree on what software documentation *actually is*.  This question is not quite so simple as it might initially seem; documentation comes in a wide variety of forms (e.g. example projects, usage guides, API docs, comments) and can be located in a wide variety of places (e.g. in-source, hosted documents, help menus).  What's more, some documentation is not even necessarily *material* - the choice of proper variable names and code structure can itself be a form of documentation ("self-documenting code").  The boundaries are fuzzy - concerns of documentation cannot be cleanly separated from other concerns of code architecture/style/implementation, and so documentation best-practices cannot be considered in isolation, either.

For the purposes of this guide, we will take "software documentation" to mean "material and practices meant to *facilitate understanding of software tools.*"  This is a very broad definition, and this guide will, in places, touch on the overlap between documentation and other code design concerns.  Inevitably, much of the content will be about "traditional" forms of software documentation - that is, documents that describe code.  Whenever possible, however, emphasis will be placed on the connection between this sort of documentation and the broader concept of documentation, and care will be taken to link the recommended content and form of the "traditional" documentation to broader concerns of style and coding philosophy.
